## 1. Executive Summary

The **UICT** proposes that information is the fundamental substrate of reality. Matter, energy, and spacetime are emergent phenomena corresponding to different **compression states** of the universal information field.

We demonstrate that the **Dirac Equation** is not a primitive law, but the result of an optimization process maximizing **Coherence ($\mathcal{C}$)** while minimizing **Entropy ($S$)**.

## 2. The Mass Quantization Law ($m = m_P \cdot \kappa^n$)

Mass is defined as **Recursive Depth**. The more compressed a piece of information is, the more "inertia" it possesses because it requires more causal steps to unpack.

$$m = m_{Planck} \cdot \kappa^n$$

* **$m_{Planck}$**: The Planck Mass ($\approx 1.22 \times 10^{19}$ GeV).
* **$\kappa$**: The Vacuum Compression Coefficient.
* **$n$**: The Integer Recursion Depth.

### Validated Regimes

1.  **Leptonic Regime (Pure Compression)**: $\kappa \approx 0.3017$
    **Electron**: $n=43$ (Stable Attractor). 
    **Muon**: $n=38$ (Unstable, insufficient depth).

2.  **Hadronic Regime (Noisy Compression)**: $\kappa \approx 0.500$
    **Proton**: $n=64$ (Stable Composite).

## 3. The Universal Field Equation

Physical systems evolve to maximize their informational efficiency $\mathcal{E}$:

$$\mathcal{E}[\Psi] = \frac{\mathcal{C}(\Psi|\Omega)}{S(\Psi) + \epsilon}$$

Where:
* **$\mathcal{C}$ (Coherence)**: Contextual alignment (Fisher Information). Replaces $C$.
* **$S$ (Entropy)**: Storage cost (Shannon/Kolmogorov). Replaces $H$.

### Derivation of Dirac
Optimizing $\delta(\ln \mathcal{C} - \ln S) = 0$ yields the Dirac equation:
$$(i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \Psi = 0$$

## 4. Cosmological Implications 

### The Compression Hierarchy ($\kappa$-scale)
| $\kappa$ | System | Density | Entropy $S$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0.001** | Vacuum | $\approx 0$ | Max |
| **0.3** | Leptons | Point-like | Medium |
| **0.8** | Bulk Matter | High | Low |
| **0.99** | Black Hole | Infinite | $\to 0$ |

### Dark Matter 
Dark Matter is interpreted as information in an **intermediate compression state** ($\kappa \approx 0.2$), interacting gravitationally via spacetime curvature but lacking the specific compression signature for electromagnetic coupling.

5. Conclusion

**The universe is a calculation. Mass is its memory.**
UICT unifies thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and information theory under a single generative principle: the minimization of informational entropy.
