> **"Time is not a line. It is a coordinate in the circle."**

**π-Time** replaces the arbitrary linear second with the **π-Cycle**. It acts as the heartbeat of the Lichen Universe, providing a self-verifying timestamp format where every moment is a specific digit in the infinite sequence of $\pi$.

## 🕰️ The Format
$$\pi[CYCLE].[SUB].[POSITION].[DIGIT]$$
*Example:* `π1234.057.890321.4`

## 🌌 Core Features
1.  **Universal Anchoring**: Time based on math constants, not political timezones.
2.  **Proof of Time**: The final digit acts as a checksum. If the digit doesn't match the position in $\pi$, the timestamp is fake.
3.  **Lichen Native**: Used to synchronize **FC-496** cells across the distributed system.
