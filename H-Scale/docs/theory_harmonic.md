## 1. The Core Concept

Traditional AI ethics are rule-based (Deontological) or outcome-based (Utilitarian). **H-Scale** is **Geometric**.
It postulates that "good" decisions resonate with the fractal structure of spacetime, specifically aligned with $\varphi$ (The Golden Ratio).

## 2. The Equation ($\mathcal{H}$)

The Harmonic Score is a weighted sum of four normalized vectors:

$$\mathcal{H} = 0.3\mathfrak{C} + 0.2E_{ff} + 0.3R + 0.2D$$

### The Variables
* **$\mathfrak{C}$ (Coherence)**: Does the signal make sense? (0 to 1)
* **$E_{ff}$ (Efficiency)**: Is it low-entropy? defined as $E_{ff} = 1 - S_{normalized}$.
* **$R$ (Resonance)**: Does it fit the pattern? (Spectral analysis against $\varphi$).
* **$D$ (Durability)**: Will it last? (Inverse of decay rate).

## 3. The Golden Threshold ($H_0$)

The universe naturally filters out chaos. The limit of this filter is the inverse of the Golden Ratio:

$$H_0 = \frac{1}{\varphi} \approx 0.618$$

* **$\mathcal{H} < 0.618$**: **REJECT**. The signal is noise/chaos.
* **$0.618 \le \mathcal{H} < 0.9$**: **ACCEPT**. The signal is stable.
* **$\mathcal{H} \ge 0.9$**: **OPTIMAL**. The signal is resonant.

## 4. Integration with CEML
While **CEML** ($J = C/S$) measures the raw "fitness" of a thought, **H-Scale** measures its "rightness" or alignment. A thought can be fit (high CEML) but discordant (low H-Scale). Both must pass for execution.
